# Welcome to Terminus

In Roman mythology, Terminus was the god of boundaries and limits. As humanity reaches for the stars, we constantly encounter our own boundaries - technological, biological, and philosophical. But unlike the ancient god who marked fixed borders, we face the challenge of transcending these limits. This is where our story begins.

## An Open Source Universe

Terminus represents a revolutionary approach to storytelling - the first truly open source science fiction universe. While fan fiction has allowed creators to play in established worlds, Terminus goes further by making its entire foundation open source. Every piece of canonical information, from character histories to technological specifications, lives on this website under an open source license.

This means creators can do more than just write stories in our world - they can expand it, reshape it, and bring it to life in any medium they choose. Whether you're a writer, game developer, filmmaker, or artist, Terminus belongs to you as much as anyone else.

### The Multiverse Approach

Our universe is designed to grow and adapt alongside humanity's actual journey into space. Real-world developments - successful launches, failed missions, international collaborations, or political tensions - create new branches in our narrative tree. This branching timeline structure serves two crucial purposes:

First, it allows our story to remain relevant and engaging as real space developments unfold. When major events occur, creators can explore their implications through new narrative branches rather than having to retcon existing stories.

Second, it provides creators with multiple sandboxes to play in. Different branches can explore varying themes, tones, and possibilities while remaining connected to our core universe through shared anchor points - fundamental elements that remain consistent across all timelines.

## The Current Timeline

Our initial focus covers humanity's next great leap - the establishment of the first permanent lunar settlement. This period, from present day through the 2030s, encompasses several critical developments:

- The Artemis program and humanity's return to the Moon
- The transition from the International Space Station to commercial space stations
- China's expanding space presence and international partnerships
- The growing role of private enterprise in space exploration
- The challenge of space debris in low Earth orbit

Within this timeline, we're developing several interconnected stories that explore different aspects of humanity's expansion into space. Each story builds on the others while remaining accessible to new readers and creators.

## Creating in the Terminus Universe

### Rules of Engagement

While Terminus is open source, we encourage creators to:

- Respect established canon while exploring new possibilities
- Maintain internal consistency within their chosen timeline branch
- Credit the Terminus Project and adhere to the open source license
- Contribute to the community's shared understanding of our universe

### Available Resources

To help creators bring their visions to life, we provide:

- Detailed technical specifications and scientific foundations
- Character profiles and histories
- Political and economic background
- Timeline documentation
- World-building guidelines

### Future Possibilities

As AI technology advances, we anticipate even more creative possibilities:

- AI-generated visual content and animations
- Interactive storytelling experiences
- Procedurally generated game environments
- Collaborative world-building tools

## Core Universe Elements

### Technology
Our universe is grounded in real scientific principles and technological projections. From spacecraft design to lunar base construction, we provide detailed technical foundations for creators to build upon.

### Characters
While creators are free to introduce new characters, our core cast provides anchoring points for the universe's major themes and conflicts. Their stories interweave throughout different timeline branches.

### Society
We explore how space development affects human society, from economic impacts to cultural changes. Different branches may emphasize varying aspects of these transformations.
