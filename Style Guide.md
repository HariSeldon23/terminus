# Terminus Writing Style Guide

## Core Purpose

Terminus serves as a living mirror for humanity's journey into space, helping readers see beyond immediate concerns to understand long-term implications of present-day decisions. The narrative adapts to real-world events, creating a dynamic exploration of possible futures that illuminates our present choices.

## Fundamental Principles

### Dynamic Character Fates
Character destinies exist in a state of quantum uncertainty, their futures determined by real-world events. This creates a unique form of narrative tension where present-day decisions can have profound and permanent effects on beloved characters. When major real-world events occur, their ripple effects must realistically impact character arcs, even if this means the death or misfortune of important characters. These consequences serve to illustrate the human cost of present-day decisions.

For example, if rising tensions between nations lead to new restrictive policies, characters from affected backgrounds might face tragic consequences. These outcomes should not feel artificial or forced, but rather emerge naturally from the real-world events, showing readers how present-day choices can have devastating future implications.

### Social Commentary Through Human Experience
Rather than focusing on technical details, our narrative explores how technological and social changes affect human lives, relationships, and societies. We show these impacts through personal stories that make abstract concepts tangible and relatable. When real-world events force changes in character arcs, these changes become powerful tools for understanding potential futures.

### Adaptive Storytelling
The narrative responds to real-world developments, showing potential long-term consequences of current events. This creates a "living story" that:
- Adapts character arcs based on real-world developments
- Shows how present decisions shape future possibilities
- Illuminates long-term implications through personal narratives
- Maintains internal consistency while incorporating major changes

### Character-Driven Understanding
Complex ideas are explored through human experiences rather than technical exposition. Characters serve as lenses through which readers can understand:
- How social changes affect individual lives
- The human cost of progress
- The tension between advancement and preservation
- The personal impact of species-level decisions
- How present-day choices create future consequences

## Handling Real-World Impact

### Character Fate Principles
When real-world events necessitate character deaths or misfortunes:
- The outcome should feel like a natural consequence, not forced drama
- Effects should ripple through the entire narrative ecosystem
- Changes should illuminate larger themes about human nature and society
- Character fates should help readers understand the weight of current decisions
- The impact should affect both personal and societal aspects of the story

### Narrative Integration
Real-world events should be incorporated by:
- Examining their logical consequences in the story world
- Showing impacts across different social levels
- Maintaining narrative coherence while adapting to change
- Using character fates to illuminate broader implications

## Literary Influences and Their Purpose

### Human Complexity (Dostoevsky)
From Dostoevsky, we take the deep exploration of human nature under pressure, showing:
- How people react when faced with profound change
- The psychological impact of technological advancement
- Moral struggles in a transforming world
- The persistence of human nature amid radical change

### Social Insight (Dickens)
Following Dickens's approach, we create narratives that:
- Show how large-scale changes affect all levels of society
- Reveal connections between personal stories and social movements
- Use individual narratives to illuminate systemic issues
- Make abstract social changes concrete and personal

### Revolutionary Understanding (Heinlein)
From Heinlein, we adopt:
- A clear-eyed view of how societies adapt to new environments
- Understanding of how environment shapes social structures
- The exploration of power dynamics and resistance
- The human element in technological revolution

### Philosophical Wit (Pratchett)
Pratchett's influence helps us:
- Make complex ideas accessible through humor
- Show the absurd in the serious and the serious in the absurd
- Use wit to reveal deeper truths
- Make philosophical questions engaging and approachable

## Narrative Approach

### Character Development
Characters should:
- Exist in a state of potential change based on real-world events

## Writing Style

The prose should:
