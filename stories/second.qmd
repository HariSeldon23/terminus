The Cost-Benefit Analysis

Dr. Sarah Chen reviewed the quarterly expenditure reports with the same methodical attention she'd given them for twenty years at the Lunar Development Authority. Red flags everywhere - cost overruns in life support systems, excessive maintenance hours for external robotics, rising psychological support expenses for long-term personnel.

She adjusted her reading glasses, a habit from Earth she maintained despite her enhanced vision implant. The neural modification had been expensive, but the cost-benefit analysis had shown a clear return on investment by eliminating the need for prescription replacements and reducing the medical supply payload requirements.

Her office overlooked the lunar mining operations through a narrow window - another inefficiency she'd noted in her reports. Human personnel required views of exterior operations for psychological stability, despite automated systems being perfectly capable of monitoring everything. The window's radiation shielding alone cost more than three months of robotic maintenance.

She pulled up the latest test results from Lab 7. The neural interface trials were showing promise, particularly in the reduced reaction times for emergency protocols. Still too expensive though - the hardware needed constant replacement due to radiation damage. Her fingers tapped against the desk as she considered alternatives.

"Dr. Chen?" Her assistant's voice carried the slight delay of neural transmission. "The results from the genetic trials are ready for review."

She opened the file without looking up from her cost projections. The genetic modifications had been her idea - a way to reduce the overhead of radiation shielding by adapting human tissue to withstand exposure. The ethics board had initially balked, but her presentation on the cost savings had won them over. Simple mathematics: modifying human DNA was cheaper than maintaining heavy shielding over decades of operation.

The new data showed promising results in radiation resistance, but the success rate remained frustratingly low. Too many failed subjects, too much wasted investment. She began calculating alternative approaches, the numbers flowing through her neural interface into neat columns of cost projections.

A message flashed across her visual field: "Batch 23 expired during testing. Requesting disposal authorization."

She authorized it with a thought, already adjusting her spreadsheets to account for the lost resources. A part of her remembered when such losses had disturbed her, but that had been before she fully understood the mathematics of progress. Every advance had its cost basis, its acceptable margin of failure.

Her neural interface flagged a pattern in her calculations - something she'd missed in earlier analyses. The failed subjects weren't truly losses if their neural tissue could be repurposed. Biological computing systems had shown remarkable radiation resistance. If the human trials were failing anyway...

She began drafting a new proposal, her augmented mind calculating cost savings down to the fraction of a credit. The ethics board would object, of course, but they always did initially. She'd show them the numbers, the pure, clean logic of efficiency. Humans were expensive - between life support, psychological care, and habitat maintenance. But a hybrid system, using failed subjects' neural tissue as biological processors...

Her fingers moved across the terminal, documenting the cost benefits of each proposed step. Everything properly categorized, properly justified. She'd learned long ago that any action, no matter how extreme, could be approved if the cost analysis showed sufficient savings.

The window darkened as the lunar night approached. Below, robots continued their endless work, guided by human operators whose support costs grew more burdensome each quarter. But she had found a solution - a way to reduce those costs while improving operational efficiency. The mathematics were beautiful in their clarity.

She finished her proposal and sent it for review, then turned to the next quarterly report. There would be forms to fill out, procedures to follow. Progress required proper documentation, after all.

"Dr. Chen?" Her assistant again. "Lab 7 reports neural tissue extraction complete. Shall I schedule the next batch of trials?"

She checked her cost projections once more. The numbers aligned perfectly.

"Proceed according to protocol," she said, already calculating the next quarter's efficiency improvements. "And order a complete audit of all failed subjects. We'll need accurate inventory for the new program."

She made a final note in her daily log: "Identified potential 47% reduction in operational costs through neural tissue repurposing program. Pending ethical review. Full implementation expected by Q3."

The numbers never lied. And if progress meant finding new uses for resources others might waste, well - that was simply good management. She began preparing her presentation for the board, confident in the pure, unassailable logic of her calculations.

Later, as she reviewed the death certificates, she found herself appreciating the efficiency of the new digital forms. So much cleaner than the old paper versions. Every loss properly categorized, every resource accounted for. The system worked beautifully.

She smiled, satisfied with another productive day of improvement, and began planning the next phase of optimization. The numbers would show the way, as they always had. Everything else was just inefficient sentiment.

The window darkened completely, leaving her alone with her calculations in the artificial light. Somewhere below, robots continued their work, guided by systems that would soon be improved by her innovations. The mathematics of progress marched on, pure and clean, unburdened by the inefficient weight of human consideration.

She adjusted her glasses again, a purely habitual gesture now, and turned to the next report. There would always be more inefficiencies to eliminate, more costs to optimize. That was her job, after all. Everything else was just details to be filed away in properly formatted reports.

The night shift began, and Dr. Chen continued her work, finding new ways to improve the system, one calculation at a time.
