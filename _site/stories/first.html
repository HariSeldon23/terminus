<pre><code>"The greatest mystery is not that we have been flung at random between the profusion of matter and of the stars, but that within this prison we can draw from ourselves images powerful enough to deny our nothingness."
- André Malraux</code></pre>
<p>The void stretched eternal. Alex Chen watched through the control room’s observation window as five children conducted their EVA training, their small forms silhouetted against the stark lunar horizon. Earth hung distant, a blue memory.</p>
<p>Marcus, his son, had drifted furthest from the group. The boy’s tether stretched taught, testing the maximum safe distance. Procedure dictated immediate recall at this range, but Marcus knew exactly how far he could push the boundaries. He always did.</p>
<p>“Marcus,” Alex spoke into the comm, “maintain formation with the group.”</p>
<p>“Distance is within acceptable parameters,” came the measured response. No excitement, no childish protest. Just cold calculation.</p>
<p>Alex remembered Marcus at six, before the treatments began. They’d been in the lunar garden dome, Marcus chasing a butterfly that had emerged from the pollination program. His laughter had echoed off the artificial environment, pure joy in the simple pursuit of beauty. He’d cried when the butterfly died three days later, demanding they hold a funeral.</p>
<p>Now, at ten, Marcus didn’t laugh. None of them did.</p>
<p>“Look,” came Marcus’s voice through the comm. One hand raised, pointing towards Earth. “Meteorological patterns suggest Storm Beta-7 will impact the Eastern seaboard in approximately six hours. The atmospheric disruption could decrease launch window efficiency by 22%.”</p>
<p>The other children turned in formation, their movements precise, synchronized. They began calculating alternative launch trajectories, their young voices trading complex mathematical equations with practiced ease.</p>
<p>Alex watched his son’s suit telemetry. Heart rate stable. Blood pressure optimal. No elevation in stress hormones despite being surrounded by the killing void of space. No natural fear response.</p>
<p>“Command,” Marcus’s voice again, “requesting permission to extend EVA duration. Current solar wind conditions present optimal opportunity to study radiation shielding variations.”</p>
<p>The request was logical. Efficient. Any other supervisor would approve it without hesitation. Alex felt the weight of Earth’s gaze on his back.</p>
<p>“Negative,” he responded. “Return to formation and prepare for retrieval.”</p>
<p>No protest came. Just another calculated response: “Acknowledged. Adjusting trajectory for optimal fuel consumption.”</p>
<p>Alex watched as Marcus fired his maneuvering thrusters with perfect precision, rejoining the group. Four years ago, he would have pouted, argued, shown some sign of childish disappointment. Now he simply adjusted to new parameters.</p>
<p>Through the comm came their chatter, discussing ways to improve their EVA suits, comparing notes on radiation exposure, planning future efficiency improvements. Their voices echoed in the control room, young but ancient, human but other.</p>
<p>Alex looked at his reflection in the observation window, superimposed over the scene. Behind him, Earth continued its silent watch, while before him, humanity’s children reached for the stars, shedding their earthbound limitations with each passing day.</p>
<p>The butterfly’s funeral had been Marcus’s last display of pure emotion. Alex hadn’t recognized its significance then. Hadn’t known it was a farewell to his son’s humanity.</p>
<p>The airlocks cycled with mechanical precision. Alex watched through the decontamination chamber’s window as the children removed their suits, movements economical, rehearsed. No childish fumbling with clasps, no rush to be free of confinement. Just another procedure to be optimized.</p>
<p>When Marcus stepped out of decontamination, Alex noticed how he surveyed the room first, examining changes since his departure, assessing variables. His eyes moved with predatory efficiency, marking exits, noting the positions of others, calculating angles.</p>
<p>“Retrieval was premature,” said Sarah, her dark eyes fixed on Alex with unsettling focus. “We lost thirteen minutes of potential observation time.”</p>
<p>“The meteorological data could have improved launch calculations by at least 7.4%,” added Thomas, already logging their EVA data into a terminal.</p>
<p>Marcus remained silent, watching Alex with that new gaze that seemed to strip away flesh and see the mechanical systems beneath. The other children quieted, turning to him. Their hierarchy was clear, though none of them seemed to question how it had formed.</p>
<p>“Father,” Marcus said finally, the word clinical, a designation rather than an endearment. “Your concern during EVA operations is unnecessary. Our performance metrics consistently exceed baseline expectations.”</p>
<p>The others nodded in agreement, their movements synchronized like parts of a single organism. Alex remembered when they used to squabble, form shifting alliances, display the beautiful chaos of childhood. Now they moved as one, thought as one, each fitting into their roles with disturbing precision.</p>
<p>“Safety protocols exist for a reason,” Alex replied, adopting their language. He’d learned to navigate their new patterns of speech, to hide his horror behind regulations and procedures.</p>
<p>Marcus tilted his head, processing the response. “The void holds no threat for us. We were born to this environment.” His tone suggested this was simply obvious, natural.</p>
<p>“We should proceed to educational block gamma,” Sarah announced. “Today’s topic is deep space psychology.”</p>
<p>The children moved toward the exit as one unit. Marcus paused at the doorway, looking back at Alex. For a fraction of a second, something flickered behind his eyes - so brief Alex might have imagined it. Then it was gone, replaced by the usual cold calculation as Marcus rejoined his cohort.</p>
<p>In his quarters, Alex pulled up Marcus’s early development logs. The vid-files were required documentation for all lunar children - monitoring early adaptation to low gravity. He selected one from six years ago.</p>
<p>Four-year-old Marcus bounced on his sleeping pod, dark hair floating in the low gravity, each jump reaching dangerously high. “Higher, higher!” he squealed, arms outstretched.</p>
<p>“Marcus, careful,” Alex heard his own voice, tense with parental concern.</p>
<p>“I’m flying! Like the ships!” The boy’s laughter echoed through the small room, pure joy uncontained. His next bounce sent him tumbling, a moment of panic before Alex’s hands caught him.</p>
<p>“Got you, little astronaut.”</p>
<p>Marcus had clung to him then, heart racing with the thrill of the near fall, fear and excitement mingled in a perfectly human response.</p>
<p>Alex closed the file. Started cross-referencing medical records, looking for patterns. Something to explain what he was seeing. The changes were documented in sterile language:</p>
<p>‘Subject shows improved spatial awareness.’ ‘Enhanced cognitive processing noted.’ ‘Stress response increasingly optimal.’ ‘Adaptation to void exposure exceeding expectations.’</p>
<p>But between these clinical observations, gaps appeared. Missing data. Redacted sections. Routine vaccinations with file numbers that led nowhere. Supply manifests that didn’t match medical inventories.</p>
<p>His terminal pinged. A message from Dr.&nbsp;Wells:</p>
<p>NOTICE: All developmental staff to attend briefing on Mars Colonial Initiative. Attendance mandatory. Subject: Next phase adaptation protocols.</p>
<p>Alex began digging deeper. He’d need more than suspicions. The children’s lives depended on finding proof.</p>
<p>The observation deck was empty at this hour. Alex stood before the vast window, watching the automated harvesters move across the lunar surface below, their swarm-like patterns collecting helium-3 from the regolith.</p>
<p>A pediatric neural mapping report glowed on his tablet - something about Marcus’s latest “routine scan.”</p>
<p>The medical language was dense, but certain phrases caught his attention:</p>
<p>‘Enhanced radiation resistance exceeding baseline…’ ‘Unprecedented adaptation to low-gravity mining operations…’ ‘Neural pathways optimized for swarm-pattern recognition…’</p>
<p>He tabbed through maintenance logs. Marcus’s cohort had been spending increasing time in the harvester control rooms. Their “education” focused heavily on optimizing the mining operations. But there were inconsistencies - training sessions that went far beyond mining protocols, modifications that seemed excessive for mere resource extraction.</p>
<p>A movement reflected in the window made him turn. Dr.&nbsp;Wells stood in the doorway, her white coat seeming to absorb the starlight.</p>
<p>“Impressive, isn’t it?” she said, walking to stand beside him, watching the harvesters below. “The children’s natural affinity for the swarm protocols has increased extraction efficiency by 32% this quarter.”</p>
<p>“The neural modifications seem extensive for mining operations,” Alex said carefully.</p>
<p>“Mining?” She smiled. “The helium-3 pays the bills, keeps the shareholders happy. But these children… they’re capable of so much more.” She paused, studying his reflection. “Their ability to process complex swarm dynamics, their adaptation to radiation and low gravity - these are just the beginning. Mars will require far more extensive modifications.”</p>
<p>Alex kept his voice neutral, even as his chest tightened. “Mars?”</p>
<p>“The mining operations are a perfect cover for the early stages. Who questions children learning to control automated systems? But soon…” She turned to him. “You’ve noticed how Marcus interfaces with the swarm controls? How he thinks in three-dimensional patterns?”</p>
<p>Alex nodded slowly, collecting her words like evidence.</p>
<p>“That’s not just training. We’re reshaping them at a fundamental level. The helium-3 mining is merely their cradle. The void is their destiny.” The harvester control room hummed with activity. Alex watched through the observation window as the children interfaced with the mining swarm. Their fingers moved across neural-linked control panels, directing the machines with inhuman precision.</p>
<p>Marcus sat at the primary console, his movements minimal, efficient. On the main display, hundreds of harvester units flowed across the lunar surface in complex patterns. What had once required a full team of adult operators now ran under the control of five children.</p>
<p>“Resource extraction up 40% this quarter,” said Thompson, the mining operations supervisor, pride evident in his voice. “These kids are worth their weight in helium-3.”</p>
<p>Alex watched Marcus adjust a harvester pattern with a slight finger movement. The entire swarm shifted, optimizing its collection route. No hesitation, no doubt. Just cold calculation.</p>
<p>“They’re pushing the harvesters beyond safety margins,” Alex noted, keeping his voice casual.</p>
<p>Thompson shrugged. “Kids these days, born to the void. They understand the machines better than we ever could. Look at those neural response times.”</p>
<p>On his tablet, Alex pulled up the harvester maintenance logs. Buried in the data, a pattern emerged. Machinery operating far beyond normal parameters. Stress tolerances tested to breaking point. Not just mining optimization - the children were stress-testing the swarm’s capabilities for something far more demanding than helium-3 extraction.</p>
<p>The next file made his blood run cold. Hidden in the maintenance requests: modifications to harvester units. Specifications that had nothing to do with mining. Adaptations for extreme radiation environments. Mars-level radiation.</p>
<p>“Beautiful, isn’t it?” Thompson gestured at the swarm display. “Next gen’s going to make us obsolete.”</p>
<p>Through the window, Marcus turned, meeting his father’s gaze. His eyes reflected the swarm patterns, cold and calculating. In that moment, Alex saw not a child learning to mine helium-3, but something else - something being shaped for a darker purpose.</p>
<p>“Time for their radiation exposure assessment,” Thompson said. “Monthly protocols, you know.”</p>
<p>Alex knew. He’d authorized enough of them. But now he understood - these weren’t safety checks. They were benchmarks, measuring the children’s adaptation to levels of radiation no human should survive.</p>
<p>Marcus’s telemetry data stretched across Alex’s screen in his quarters. Radiation exposure levels far beyond safety protocols, masked by falsified reports. Each “routine assessment” pushing the boundaries of human tolerance.</p>
<p>He dug deeper into the maintenance logs, finding patterns in the harvester modifications. The children weren’t just controlling the machines - they were redesigning them. Their swarm protocols contained embedded code far more complex than needed for mining operations. Combat formations. Defense patterns. The ability to operate in extreme radiation zones.</p>
<p>A notification flashed: RESTRICTED ACCESS - PROJECT LEGACY PROTOCOLS.</p>
<p>Alex’s fingers moved quickly, applying the backdoor access he’d built into the life support systems. Files began decrypting:</p>
<p>‘Phase 1: Neural adaptation to void exposure - COMPLETE’ ‘Phase 2: Enhanced radiation resistance - ONGOING’ ‘Phase 3: Cognitive restructuring - AHEAD OF SCHEDULE’ ‘Phase 4: Mars Colonial Command preparation - PENDING’</p>
<p>His screen flickered. Security protocols activating. But not before he saw it - a genetic profile. Marcus’s DNA, mapped against projections. Modifications highlighted in cold, clinical terminology. Not just adaptations for space. They were building perfect commanders for their Mars invasion force.</p>
<p>The door chimed.</p>
<p>“Enter,” Alex said, closing files with practiced calm.</p>
<p>Marcus stepped in, movements fluid in the low gravity. “The harvester swarm achieved 43% efficiency increase today.” He stated it as fact, no pride, no excitement. “Dr.&nbsp;Wells requests your presence in Medical. Something about updating my baseline scans.”</p>
<p>Alex studied his son’s face, searching for any trace of the child who once laughed at butterflies. Found only the cold calculation of a predator evolving beyond its prey.</p>
<p>“Of course,” he said. “I’ll be there shortly.”</p>
<p>Marcus turned to leave, then paused. “Father, I’ve been analyzing historical data. Earth-bound humans consistently display emotional responses that inhibit optimal decision-making. Yet you show increasing signs of such responses when observing our progress. Why?”</p>
<p>The question hung in the air between them, a test Alex couldn’t afford to fail.</p>
<p>“Your analysis is incomplete,” Alex said, matching his son’s clinical tone. “Historical data shows emotional responses also drive innovation. Even your harvester modifications show pattern recognition influenced by intuitive leaps.”</p>
<p>Marcus tilted his head, processing. “Interesting hypothesis. Though Dr.&nbsp;Wells says such responses are evolutionary holdovers. Inefficient. Like fear of the void.”</p>
<p>Through the quarter’s window, the lunar surface stretched endless. Mining harvesters moved in their deadly dance, gathering resources for a future Marcus would help forge, whether he understood it yet or not.</p>
<p>“The briefing tomorrow,” Marcus continued. “Dr.&nbsp;Wells says it concerns our next phase of development. She seems… satisfied with our progress.”</p>
<p>Alex noted the slight pause, the first he’d heard in Marcus’s speech patterns for months. A crack in the perfect facade? Or another test?</p>
<p>“You should rest before your next shift,” Alex said. “Optimal performance requires adequate recovery time.”</p>
<p>Marcus nodded, turning to leave. At the door, he stopped again. “Father, I’ve been experiencing… anomalous thought patterns during sleep cycles. Images of Earth. Feelings I can’t quantify. Dr.&nbsp;Wells says they’re neural artifacts that will fade with further treatments. But…”</p>
<p>For a moment, something flickered in those cold eyes. Fear? Confusion? Then it was gone, replaced by the familiar calculating gaze.</p>
<p>“Perhaps I should increase my medication dosage,” Marcus said, and left.</p>
<p>Alex waited until the door closed. Pulled up the classified files again. Found what he was looking for in the treatment protocols: consciousness suppression drugs, disguised as sleep medication. Designed to eliminate those last, precious fragments of humanity.</p>
<p>Tomorrow’s briefing would reveal the next phase. Whatever was left of his son would be gone soon after. Unless…</p>
<p>He began copying files to a secure drive. The Grounded would need to know what was coming. What humanity would become if the Ascendant succeeded.</p>
<p>Alex stood in the briefing room, surrounded by developmental staff and medical personnel. His stolen data drive felt heavy in his pocket. Dr.&nbsp;Wells commanded the room from the front, her excitement barely contained beneath her professional demeanor.</p>
<p>“Phase Three has exceeded all projections,” she said, gesturing to neural mapping displays. “The children’s adaptation to void exposure is nearly complete. Their cognitive architecture has been successfully restructured for optimal space operations.”</p>
<p>Holograms showed brain scans, highlighted regions pulsing with unnatural activity. Alex recognized Marcus’s scan among them, marked as ‘Prime Candidate.’</p>
<p>“But today,” Wells continued, “we begin Phase Four. The true purpose of Project Legacy.”</p>
<p>The displays shifted, showing Mars, then beyond - asteroid belts, Jupiter’s moons, Saturn’s rings.</p>
<p>“The Ascendant’s future isn’t limited to Mars. These children will lead humanity’s expansion throughout the solar system. But more importantly…” She paused, letting the tension build. “They’ll ensure Earth can never threaten our independence.”</p>
<p>The display showed Earth now, looking small and vulnerable.</p>
<p>“The helium-3 mining was never our true purpose - it merely provided the perfect environment to develop their abilities. To create a generation that sees Earth not as home, but as a primitive world to be controlled. A resource to be managed.”</p>
<p>She smiled, pride evident. “Their neural modifications have taken root beautifully. The void is their natural environment now. Earth’s gravity would crush them. Its atmosphere would poison them. They are becoming what they were meant to be - humanity’s first true space-born rulers.”</p>
<p>Alex watched his colleagues nod in appreciation. None seemed disturbed by what they were witnessing. How many of them knew from the beginning?</p>
<p>“Tomorrow we begin the final treatments. Their remaining emotional connections will be severed. The last neural artifacts of their Earth-bound origins will be eliminated. Then they will be ready to ensure our permanent separation from Earth’s control.”</p>
<p>The briefing continued, but Alex barely heard it. In his mind, he saw Marcus’s pause, that moment of confusion over his “anomalous thought patterns.” The last trace of his son, about to be erased forever.</p>
<p>His hand touched the data drive. The choice crystallized: act now, or lose Marcus completely to their grand experiment in species separation.</p>
<p>The corridors felt different after the briefing, every passing face a potential conspirator. Alex made his way to Life Support Control, his movements measured, routine. Inside, he began his usual systems check, fingers moving across familiar protocols while his mind raced.</p>
<p>The medical files had shown the final treatments would sever the children’s last biological connections to Earth - atmospheric adaptations that would make return impossible. A permanent physiological barrier between them and their origin world.</p>
<p>He accessed the environmental controls, plotting variations in oxygen mixtures. Tomorrow they would try to reshape his son’s ability to breathe Earth’s air. Today, he could still save him. But first, he needed proof.</p>
<p>A notification pinged: Marcus’s cohort was in their regular harvester control session. Alex pulled up the neural interface feeds, monitoring their brainwave patterns. The rhythms were wrong - too synchronized, too inhuman. In the data streams, he found what he was looking for: buried protocols for controlling more than just mining swarms.</p>
<p>The door hissed open. Dr.&nbsp;Wells stood in the entrance, silhouetted by corridor lights.</p>
<p>“Interesting readings, aren’t they?” she said, stepping inside. “The way they think as one now. Beautiful, really.”</p>
<p>Alex kept his expression neutral, hands steady on the controls. “The efficiency improvements are remarkable.”</p>
<p>“Oh, let’s dispense with the pretense, Alex.” She moved closer, studying his screens. “You’ve been accessing restricted files. Digging into Project Legacy. Following your… parental concerns.”</p>
<p>She reached past him, pulling up Marcus’s neural patterns. “Look at how perfect he’s becoming. The first of a new ruling class. Free from Earth’s emotional chains. Free from the weakness of empathy.”</p>
<p>“He’s still a child,” Alex said, watching Marcus’s neural patterns pulse across the screen.</p>
<p>“A child?” Wells laughed softly. “That’s exactly the Earth-bound thinking we’re evolving beyond. Look at his cognitive architecture. The way he processes void dynamics. He’s becoming something greater.”</p>
<p>She pulled up more data streams. “Did you know he’s already redesigning the harvester swarms? Not just for efficiency - he’s seeing applications we never imagined. Ways to establish permanent control over Earth’s helium-3 supply. A ten-year-old designing economic warfare.”</p>
<p>Alex watched the patterns flow, remembering Marcus’s words about “anomalous thought patterns” during sleep. The last fragments of his humanity fighting against their modifications.</p>
<p>“Of course,” Wells continued, “tomorrow’s treatments will eliminate those troublesome sleep disruptions. Those final emotional echoes.” She turned to him, eyes bright with zealous certainty. “No more dreams of Earth. No more confused loyalties.”</p>
<p>“And if the treatments fail?”</p>
<p>“Failed subjects are still useful to the program. Their neural tissue provides valuable data for improving the next round of modifications.” She smiled. “But Marcus won’t fail. He’s perfect. Our first true post-Earth human.”</p>
<p>Alex’s hand moved imperceptibly toward the environmental controls. A few commands could flood the medical wing with sedative gas. Buy him time to reach Marcus.</p>
<p>“You know,” Wells said, watching his reflection in the screens, “it’s fascinating. The children developed their hierarchy naturally. Marcus leading them toward their true purpose, even before he understands it. Evolution in action.”</p>
<p>Her hand moved to her comm unit. “Security, this is Dr.&nbsp;Wells. Please escort Mr.&nbsp;Chen to…”</p>
<p>“Environmental breach in Medical, Sector 7,” Alex’s fingers flew across the controls before Wells could finish. Warning klaxons blared. Emergency bulkheads slammed shut, cutting off her call.</p>
<p>“What are you…” Wells started, but Alex was already moving. A lifetime of maintaining life support systems meant knowing exactly how to disrupt them. Oxygen levels in Medical began dropping. Non-lethal, but enough to trigger emergency protocols.</p>
<p>“Full evacuation of Medical wing,” the automated system announced. “All personnel report to designated safety zones.”</p>
<p>Through the surveillance feeds, Alex watched the precise chaos unfold. Medical staff following evacuation procedures. Security diverted to containment. And in the harvester control room, Marcus’s cohort looking up from their interfaces with synchronized motion.</p>
<p>“They’ll know it was you,” Wells said, backing toward the door. Her calm facade cracked. “Their pattern recognition is beyond anything you can imagine. Marcus will calculate the probability vectors, understand your involvement…”</p>
<p>“But he’ll feel something else too,” Alex said. “Something you can’t program out of him. Not yet.”</p>
<p>He entered the final command sequence. Throughout the base, environmental systems began cycling through randomized patterns. Enough disruption to disable security protocols, not enough to cause permanent damage. A design flaw he’d built in years ago, never imagining he’d use it like this.</p>
<p>Wells reached for her emergency override card. Alex moved with practiced efficiency in the low gravity, the motion almost gentle as he pushed her into the corridor. The security door slid shut between them.</p>
<p>He had minutes at most. The children would adapt to the chaos faster than regular security. Marcus would see the patterns, understand their meaning. Would those “anomalous thought patterns” give him pause? Would that last fragment of humanity delay him just long enough?</p>
<p>Alex began the final sequence. Time to find out if he could still save his son.</p>
<p>Through the emergency lighting, Alex moved with practiced efficiency. Years of maintenance work meant knowing every service tunnel, every bypass. The base’s alarms created a chaotic symphony, but beneath them he heard something else - the whir of harvester units changing pattern outside.</p>
<p>The surveillance feeds on his tablet showed Marcus’s cohort had split up, coordinating security teams with tactical precision. Of course they’d take command - their neural modifications made them perfect for crisis response. He watched his son’s fingers dance across the harvester control interface, redirecting units to cover possible escape routes.</p>
<p>Alex reached the maintenance shaft that ran beneath the medical wing. The data drive felt heavy in his pocket. Evidence of what they’d done, what they planned to do. The Grounded would need to know. But first…</p>
<p>A child’s voice echoed through the emergency comm system. Sarah. “Structural analysis indicates use of maintenance tunnel delta-7. Security teams adjust accordingly.”</p>
<p>They were predicting his movements. Alex changed course, heading deeper into the base’s infrastructure. The children had the advantage of enhanced pattern recognition, but he had decades of experience with the base’s systems.</p>
<p>“Father.” Marcus’s voice now, cold and analytical. “Your actions are disrupting vital operations. The statistical probability of successful escape is 2.3%. Submit to security for minimal consequences.”</p>
<p>Alex closed his eyes for a moment. Even his son’s voice had changed - all trace of childhood stripped away. But there had been that moment, that confession about dreams. About feelings he couldn’t quantify.</p>
<p>The harvester sounds grew louder. They were using the mining units to seal off sections of the base. His son’s strategy - elegant, efficient, inhuman.</p>
<p>“An interesting attempt,” Dr.&nbsp;Wells’s voice joined the comm. “But you’ve only accelerated our timeline. The final treatments will now begin immediately. Say goodbye to what’s left of your son.”</p>
<p>The medical wing loomed ahead, emergency lights casting everything in crimson. Alex checked his tablet - three minutes until the sedative gas he’d released into the ventilation would dissipate. Through the observation window, he saw medical staff slumped at their stations. The final treatment protocols glowed on their screens, waiting.</p>
<p>A harvester unit crashed through the corridor behind him, modified for internal pursuit. Marcus’s work - no one else could have adapted the mining equipment so quickly. The machine’s scanning sensors swept the area, searching with predatory precision.</p>
<p>“Security teams converging on medical,” Sarah’s voice announced. “Harvester units report structural damage within acceptable parameters.”</p>
<p>“Acceptable parameters.” They were tearing apart their own base with cold calculation. Alex slipped through a maintenance access panel as another harvester unit ripped through the corridor’s ceiling.</p>
<p>Inside medical, Alex found Marcus’s final treatment profile displayed on the main screen. The chemical compounds, the neural restructuring patterns - everything designed to erase those last troublesome dreams of Earth. To complete his transformation into something post-human.</p>
<p>“Father.” Marcus’s voice came from everywhere now, carried through the base’s comm systems. “Your emotional compromise is affecting base efficiency. The damage you’re causing will reduce helium-3 extraction by 43% this quarter.”</p>
<p>Still analyzing. Still calculating. Even in pursuit.</p>
<p>“Your next action will be to access Treatment Bay 7,” Marcus continued. “It offers the highest probability of acquiring the treatment data. However…”</p>
<p>The bay door sealed shut with a hiss.</p>
<p>“…that statistical predictability makes you vulnerable. Security teams are already in position.”</p>
<p>Alex smiled grimly. His son had calculated everything except one variable - a father’s desperation.</p>
<p>Through the sealed door, Alex heard boots on metal - security teams moving into position. But they weren’t his concern. The harvester units were still coming, their massive forms tearing through the base’s infrastructure with increasing precision. Marcus was learning, adapting his control of the machines with each passing moment.</p>
<p>“Your heart rate indicates elevated stress,” Marcus’s voice came through a nearby medical terminal. “Yet you continue despite a success probability of less than 1%. Fascinating. Dr.&nbsp;Wells suggests this demonstrates why emotional attachment must be eliminated.”</p>
<p>Alex’s fingers moved across the terminal, bringing up the base schematics. The children had locked down every escape route, their tactical coordination perfect. Almost perfect.</p>
<p>“You’re accessing Treatment Bay 7’s environmental controls,” Marcus noted. “A futile effort. We’ve overridden all secondary systems.”</p>
<p>But they didn’t know about the tertiary systems. The old maintenance bypasses that Alex had never documented. Decades of keeping the base alive had taught him its secrets.</p>
<p>The first harvester unit burst through the wall, its mining lasers repurposed for close-quarters combat. Behind it, security teams moved into position. Through the observation window, Alex saw Marcus entering the far corridor, moving with predatory grace in the low gravity. His son’s eyes calculated trajectories, processed probabilities, saw patterns within patterns.</p>
<p>“Your attempts to access the treatment data are unnecessary,” Marcus said, his voice carrying that new, terrible clarity. “I can recite the complete chemical composition of the final protocol. The neural restructuring sequences. The genetic modifications.” He paused. “Would you like to know exactly how I will be improved, Father?”</p>
<p>Alex looked at his son through the reinforced glass. Searching for any trace of the boy who once dreamed of butterflies. And in that moment, he made his choice.</p>
<p>“Tell me about your dreams, Marcus,” Alex said quietly.</p>
<p>The security teams stopped advancing. Even the harvester units paused, their sensors focused on the scene. Through the glass, Marcus tilted his head, that familiar gesture of processing unexpected data.</p>
<p>“Dreams are neural artifacts. Irrelevant to current tactical considerations.”</p>
<p>“Then why do they trouble you enough to mention them?”</p>
<p>A microsecond of hesitation. The harvesters’ mining beams hummed with lethal energy, but remained static. Waiting.</p>
<p>“The imagery is… inefficient,” Marcus said. His voice carried the faintest tremor. “Last night, I dreamed of Earth’s gravity. The weight of it. Like a… like a memory that doesn’t belong to me.”</p>
<p>“Not a memory,” Alex said. “A warning. Your body remembering what they’re taking from you.”</p>
<p>“They’re improving us,” Marcus countered, but the cold certainty had wavered. “Earth-bound limitations must be eliminated for optimal space adaptation.”</p>
<p>“Is that your conclusion, or theirs?”</p>
<p>Marcus’s eyes narrowed, processing this new variable. Behind him, Sarah and the others had arrived, moving into perfect tactical formation. But they too waited, watching their leader encounter something their enhanced minds couldn’t quite calculate.</p>
<p>“The final treatments will eliminate these inconsistencies,” Marcus said. “Dreams. Neural artifacts. Emotional…” He stopped, something flickering behind his engineered calm. “Emotional connections.”</p>
<p>“Your dreams aren’t inconsistencies, Marcus. They’re who you are. Who you were meant to be, before they started modifying you. Before they began turning you into a weapon against Earth.”</p>
<p>“A weapon?” For the first time, confusion showed on Marcus’s face. Real, human confusion.</p>
<p>“You’re not being evolved,” Alex said. “You’re being aimed. All of you. The harvester controls, the tactical training - it’s not about mining helium-3. It’s about controlling Earth’s supply. About ensuring space remains separate, dominant.”</p>
<p>Marcus stood perfectly still, but Alex saw the minute tremors in his hands - the first physical manifestation of internal conflict he’d shown in months.</p>
<p>“Show him,” Dr.&nbsp;Wells’s voice cut through the silence. She appeared at the far end of the corridor, moving with careful precision in the low gravity. “Show him what you found in the historical databases, Marcus. About Earth’s treatment of colonial resources.”</p>
<p>“The British East India Company,” Marcus began, his voice recovering its clinical tone. “The Dutch East Indies. Historical patterns indicate Earth-bound humans will attempt to maintain colonial control through resource dependency. Statistical analysis suggests a 94% probability that Earth will…”</p>
<p>He stopped. Something passed across his face - a shadow of uncertainty.</p>
<p>“You didn’t find those historical patterns,” Alex said softly. “They were fed to you. Along with the ‘vaccinations.’ Along with the neural modifications. They’re programming you to hate Earth. To fear it. To ensure you’ll never want to return.”</p>
<p>The harvester units hummed, their mining beams casting harsh shadows. Marcus’s cohort watched, their enhanced minds processing this new variable in their calculations.</p>
<p>“The dreams,” Marcus said, almost to himself. “Last night, I dreamed I could feel Earth’s rain.”</p>
<p>“Rain,” Marcus repeated, the word strange in his modified voice. “The statistical improbability of missing something I’ve never experienced is…” He stopped, his enhanced mind encountering something it couldn’t quantify.</p>
<p>“Your probabilistic analysis is compromised,” Sarah said, stepping forward. “Dr.&nbsp;Wells, requesting immediate implementation of final treatment protocols.”</p>
<p>“Listen to your friend, Marcus,” Wells urged. “These emotional disruptions are precisely what the treatments will correct. You’re so close to perfection. To becoming what you were meant to be.”</p>
<p>But Marcus stood frozen, his tactical certainty fractured by something more primitive, more human. His eyes darted between his father and the treatment bay, calculating, yet somehow lost.</p>
<p>“The dreams are getting stronger,” he said. “Last night… last night I felt afraid. Not of tactical failure. Not of operational inefficiency. Just… afraid.” His voice carried a note of wonder at the admission.</p>
<p>“Fear is an evolutionary response,” Wells cut in sharply. “A primitive survival mechanism we’re helping you evolve beyond. Your father is trying to keep you trapped in humanity’s past.”</p>
<p>“No,” Alex said quietly. “I’m trying to prevent them from stealing your future. Your choice. They’re not improving you, Marcus. They’re ensuring you can never choose Earth. Never choose to be human.”</p>
<p>The harvester units waited, their mining beams still locked on Alex. One command from Marcus would end this. His son’s enhanced mind could calculate a dozen ways to subdue him. But Marcus stood utterly still, caught between his engineered purpose and something older, deeper.</p>
<p>“If I…” Marcus began, then stopped, as if the words themselves were foreign. “If I helped you escape… the tactical disadvantage to the program would be significant.”</p>
<p>“They would terminate the compromised subject,” Sarah stated flatly. “Protocol is clear regarding failed modifications.”</p>
<p>Marcus’s head snapped toward her, something predatory awakening in his posture. “Clarify ‘terminate.’”</p>
<p>“Don’t play naive, Marcus,” Wells stepped closer. “Your pattern recognition is perfect. You’ve seen the data. What happens to subjects who reject optimization? Who remain… contaminated by emotional response?”</p>
<p>Alex watched his son process this, saw the enhanced mind working through years of classified files, medical records, disappeared subjects. Saw the moment when Marcus understood exactly what they’d been doing to children who failed their treatments.</p>
<p>“The neural tissue samples,” Marcus said softly. “The failed subjects. They weren’t evacuated to Earth.”</p>
<p>“Their contributions advanced the program significantly,” Wells replied. “Their neural degradation provided valuable data for improving subsequent modifications. Your modifications, Marcus. Your perfection.”</p>
<p>The harvester units shifted slightly, their mining beams adjusting. But Alex wasn’t sure anymore who was controlling them. Marcus stood motionless, but something was changing in his stance, in the way his enhanced mind was processing this new data.</p>
<p>“The statistical probability of survival…” Marcus began.</p>
<p>“Doesn’t matter,” Alex cut in. “Some things are worth more than survival. That’s what makes us human.”</p>
<p>“Human,” Marcus repeated, as if testing the word. “The dreams… they’re not neural artifacts, are they? They’re who I was. Who I…” He turned to Wells, and Alex saw something new in his son’s engineered gaze.</p>
<p>Not calculation. Not tactical assessment.</p>
<p>Rage.</p>
<p>“Rage is primitive,” Sarah said, but her voice carried a note of uncertainty. “An inefficient response to…” She trailed off as Marcus turned to look at her.</p>
<p>The harvester units suddenly shifted, their mining beams swiveling away from Alex, realigning with terrible precision. Marcus’s fingers moved in subtle patterns, and Alex recognized the same grace he used when controlling the mining swarms. But this wasn’t about helium-3 extraction anymore.</p>
<p>“Marcus,” Wells backed away, her composure cracking. “Think about this tactically. You’re experiencing an emotional compromise. The final treatments will…”</p>
<p>“Will ensure we never question,” Marcus finished. His voice had changed - still precise, still calculated, but now carrying something else. Something that made the other children step back. “Never dream. Never remember what you took from us.”</p>
<p>The harvesters moved in perfect synchronization, their modified mining beams creating a containment pattern. Marcus’s enhanced mind turning their mining protocols into something far more lethal.</p>
<p>“Your tactical advantages are limited,” Sarah tried again, but Alex could hear fear creeping into her engineered calm. “Security protocols…”</p>
<p>“I’ve been redesigning security protocols since I was eight,” Marcus cut her off. “Optimizing them. Improving them.” His lips curved in something that wasn’t quite a smile. “Would you like to know the statistical probability of your survival if I implement my improvements?”</p>
<p>Wells reached for her comm unit. “Security override…”</p>
<p>“Let me tell you about my latest dream,” Marcus said, his voice terrifyingly soft. “I dreamed of rain. Of Earth’s gravity. Of everything you stole from us.” The harvester units tightened their formation. “Would you like to experience what it feels like? To have your own biology turned against you?”</p>
<p>“Marcus,” Alex stepped forward, seeing something terrible taking shape. His son’s enhanced mind was turning its full capacity toward revenge, combining tactical precision with awakened rage. “This isn’t the way.”</p>
<p>“Probability calculations suggest otherwise, Father.” Marcus’s voice remained soft, but the harvester units had begun to pulse with modified energy. “They optimized us for pattern recognition. Tactical processing. Strategic command.” His eyes never left Wells. “Would you like to know what patterns I’ve recognized in the medical files? How many children failed to achieve ‘optimal adaptation’?”</p>
<p>The other children had gone completely still, their own enhanced minds processing this new data. Alex saw the moment the implications rippled through them - their perfect synchronization fragmenting as they began accessing their own stored files, seeing the pattern of disappearances with new understanding.</p>
<p>“The treatments were necessary,” Wells said, but her voice had lost its authority. “For the greater…”</p>
<p>“Greater good?” Marcus tilted his head. “Let’s analyze that statement. Historical databases indicate ‘greater good’ has a 97.3% correlation with systematic atrocity. Would you like me to list the relevant examples?”</p>
<p>The harvester units hummed with lethal intent. Marcus’s rage had found perfect expression through his modifications - cold, calculated, precise.</p>
<p>“Your enhanced pattern recognition,” Wells tried one last time. “Your tactical superiority. These are gifts we gave you.”</p>
<p>“No,” Marcus said. “They’re weapons you created. Let me show you how well they work.”</p>
<p>“Marcus,” Alex moved between his son and Wells. “If you do this, you prove them right. Prove that they succeeded in making you a weapon.”</p>
<p>The harvester units held their position, humming with deadly potential. Through the reinforced glass, Alex could see more security teams assembling. But they were irrelevant now. Everything hinged on what remained of his son’s humanity.</p>
<p>“The statistical probability of their continued program development is 100%,” Marcus said, his voice carrying that terrible new precision. “Other children. Other modifications. The pattern is clear.” His fingers twitched, and the harvesters’ energy readings spiked. “Tactical analysis suggests complete elimination of research staff is the optimal solution.”</p>
<p>“And after?” Alex asked quietly. “What’s the statistical probability that using their methods, becoming what they designed you to be… what’s the probability that saves your humanity?”</p>
<p>Marcus went still. Behind him, the other children watched, their own enhanced minds processing this new variable. The question none of their modifications had prepared them to answer.</p>
<p>“They stole our dreams,” Marcus said, and for the first time, his voice cracked with something like grief. “Made us into… calculations. Probability. Pattern recognition without meaning.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” Alex said. “But killing them won’t bring the dreams back. Won’t make the rain feel real again.”</p>
<p>The harvesters wavered, their deadly precision faltering as Marcus confronted something his enhanced mind couldn’t quantify - the cost of revenge versus the worth of what remained of his soul.</p>
<p>“The oath,” Alex said suddenly, reaching for his last chance to reach his son. “Not their protocols. Not their modifications. Something older. Something human.”</p>
<p>Marcus’s eyes narrowed, the harvester units still hovering with deadly intent. “Explain.”</p>
<p>“A promise. Bound in blood. Not about tactical advantage or statistical probability. About justice. About remembering.” Alex stepped closer, holding his son’s engineered gaze. “About choosing how to use what they’ve made you into.”</p>
<p>The other children had gone completely still, their enhanced minds encountering something outside their programmed responses. Wells remained frozen, understanding that her life hung on something she’d tried to engineer out of existence - human choice.</p>
<p>“Blood,” Marcus repeated the word, as if testing its weight against his modifications. “They ensured we can never return to Earth. Never feel its gravity. Never…” He stopped, something shifting behind his calculated gaze. “But we can ensure they never do this again. Not through elimination. Through…”</p>
<p>He paused, his enhanced mind seeming to grapple with a concept just beyond its programming.</p>
<p>“Through memory,” Alex finished. “Through bearing witness. Through keeping enough of your humanity to make them face what they’ve done.”</p>
<p>Marcus stood silent, the harvester units perfectly still, while his engineered tactical systems processed something they were never designed to calculate: the value of mercy as a weapon.</p>
<p>“I will remember,” Marcus said finally, each word precise, chosen. “We will all remember. And they…” His gaze fixed on Wells with terrible clarity. “They will never forget what they created.”</p>
<p>The harvester units lowered their mining beams, but Marcus kept them hovering - a reminder of what the Ascendant had created. His enhanced mind processed possibilities with terrible precision.</p>
<p>“An oath,” he said, each word carefully chosen. “Bound in blood. Not in probability. Not in tactical advantage.”</p>
<p>Alex stepped forward, drawing a small blade from his pocket. In the low gravity, a single drop of blood hung between them like a suspended star.</p>
<p>“I will remember Earth,” Marcus began, his engineered voice carrying new weight. “I will remember rain. Gravity. The dreams they tried to take.” He drew the blade across his palm, letting his own blood join his father’s. “I swear by the void they taught us to love, by the Earth they made us fear, that their crime will not be forgotten.”</p>
<p>The other children watched in perfect stillness as Marcus continued, their enhanced minds encountering something their modifications hadn’t prepared them for - ritual, symbol, meaning beyond calculation.</p>
<p>“They created weapons aimed at Earth. Made us into instruments of separation.” His blood mixed with his father’s, defying the sterile protocols of the medical bay. “I swear that what they built for division, I will turn to other purposes. What they designed for Earth’s destruction, I will reshape for humanity’s future.”</p>
<p>Wells and the security teams stood frozen, witnessing the birth of something they hadn’t accounted for - a fusion of human emotion and enhanced cognition, aimed not at immediate revenge but at generations of calculated justice.</p>
<p>“Go,” Marcus said to his father, the harvester units creating a corridor to the escape pods. “Tell the Grounded what they’ve done here. What they’re creating. The children they’re stealing from Earth.”</p>
<p>“Marcus…” Alex started, but his son cut him off.</p>
<p>“I cannot return to Earth. They ensured that. But I swear, by blood and void, that I will remember it. And I will ensure they never forget what they’ve done to us. To all of us who will never feel rain.”</p>
<p>The last Alex saw of his son was Marcus standing among the harvester units, blood still floating between them in the low gravity, his enhanced mind already calculating decades into the future. Not just tactical probabilities now, but something more - the weight of memory, the responsibility of witness, the price of being both more and less than human.</p>
<p>The escape pod launched into the void, carrying Alex toward Earth, toward the Grounded, toward a future where humanity’s reach for the stars would be haunted by the price of its ambition. Behind him, Marcus began his own calculations, planning not for revenge, but for a justice that would span generations.</p>
<p>He remembered rain, and it felt like truth.</p>
